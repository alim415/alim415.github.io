Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.

I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at Emory University, specializing in labor economics, applied microeconomics, and early childhood education policy. My research explores the intersection of childcare markets, regulation, and labor dynamics, with a particular focus on how policy changes impact provider supply, parental demand, and workforce outcomes. I use both reduced-form and structural modeling approaches to analyze these issues, leveraging a rich dataset that spans multiple years and provider types.

Growing up in San Francisco shaped my perspective on economic policy and inequality, particularly in the areas of labor markets and childcare access. Experiencing firsthand the challenges of affordability, urban policy, and shifting labor dynamics in a city known for both innovation and stark disparities has deeply influenced my research questions. I am especially interested in how regulations affect small providers, labor supply decisions, and broader economic mobility—issues that are not only central to San Francisco but also relevant to cities and communities nationwide.

Outside of research, I enjoy open-water swimming and running. When I’m not working with data or writing, you can usually find me training for my next marathon or searching for the best bakeries in town.
